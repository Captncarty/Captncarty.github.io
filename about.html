                This project was inspired by my desire to do more! and in return gave me the opportunity to do more and invest more. This project wasn't a ball at the park as I
                had to face a project whilst not too many people had prior experience nor knowledge about. I'm grateful the few who had taken up the challenge and went ahead to 
                publish about their findings including guidelines, error checking and easy hacks. My major challenges were in the area of mathematical calculations as they were 
                quite vital if truly a 3D seamless and gaming enviromnent is to be created!

                Special Thanks to ALX for pushing me this hard!
